# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a simple UI pricing calculator for AWS Bedrock AgentCore that helps users estimate costs based on their usage patterns. The calculator will be based on the official AWS Bedrock AgentCore pricing structure and provide real-time cost estimates for different usage scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating Bedrock AgentCore, I want to input my expected usage parameters, so that I can estimate my monthly costs before committing to the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the pricing calculator THEN the system SHALL display input fields for all relevant usage parameters
2. WHEN the user enters usage values THEN the system SHALL validate that inputs are positive numbers
3. WHEN the user provides valid inputs THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the estimated monthly cost in real-time
4. WHEN the user clears inputs THEN the system SHALL reset the calculator to default state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious user, I want to see a breakdown of costs by different pricing components, so that I can understand where my money is being spent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calculator computes costs THEN the system SHALL display a detailed breakdown by pricing tier or component
2. WHEN costs are calculated THEN the system SHALL show both individual component costs and total estimated cost
3. WHEN the breakdown is displayed THEN the system SHALL clearly label each cost component with its pricing rate

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user comparing different usage scenarios, I want to easily modify my inputs and see updated calculations, so that I can explore different cost scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user modifies any input field THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate costs without requiring a submit button
2. WHEN calculations update THEN the system SHALL preserve the detailed cost breakdown format
3. WHEN inputs are invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages without breaking the interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user referencing AWS pricing, I want the calculator to reflect current Bedrock AgentCore pricing tiers, so that my estimates are accurate and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calculator loads THEN the system SHALL use current AWS Bedrock AgentCore pricing rates
2. WHEN displaying pricing information THEN the system SHALL include references to the official AWS pricing page
3. WHEN pricing tiers apply THEN the system SHALL correctly implement tiered pricing calculations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user sharing cost estimates, I want to export or share my calculation results, so that I can discuss pricing with my team or stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests to share results THEN the system SHALL provide a way to copy or export the calculation summary
2. WHEN exporting results THEN the system SHALL include both input parameters and calculated costs
3. WHEN sharing functionality is used THEN the system SHALL maintain calculation accuracy in the exported format
