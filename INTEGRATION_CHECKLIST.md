- [x] Graceful fallback UI with user-friendly error messages
- [x] Error recovery options (Try Again, Reload Page)
- [x] Development-only error details for debugging
- [x] Application-level error handling in PricingCalculator
- [x] Input validation errors display without breaking interface
- [x] Loading states during calculations

**Verification:**
- Error boundaries catch component errors and display fallback UI
- Application continues to function after recoverable errors
- Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- Development error details help with debugging

### ✅ Sub-task 3: Add application metadata and documentation comments

**Status: COMPLETED**

- [x] Comprehensive JSDoc comments in all major components
- [x] HTML meta tags for SEO and social sharing
- [x] Web app manifest for PWA capabilities
- [x] Structured data for search engines
- [x] Security headers and accessibility features
